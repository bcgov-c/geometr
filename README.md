# geometr

An R package to query Environment and Climate Change Canadaâ€™s GeoMet
webservices

## Project Status

This package is maintained by the Knowledge Management Branch of the
[British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change
Strategy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/environment-climate-change).
This project is under construction is not stable for any kind of
sustained use.

### Features

  - Currently the hydrometric historical webservice is the only data
    available through this service

### Installation

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/geometr")
```

### Usage

First we have to load the package

``` r
library(geometr)
```

The collections current supported by the geomet webservice are (as of
2019-03-15):

``` r
collections <- geomet_collection()

collections
#> # A tibble: 15 x 6
#>    title          name      description           extent crs        links

```

The envisioned API is a `geomet_data`. Currently only hydrometric is
supported:

``` r
geomet_data(parameter = "hydrometric-daily-mean", station_number = "10PC003", start_date = "1983-07-04")
```
